🏗️ Hey everyone, the Testnet chain and frontend have been updated.  
This is the release candidate `v0.1.0-rc1` for our next mainnet upgrade. 

It includes:
- More chain commands are accessible to scripts and the frontend: Vesting Accounts, Params.
- A new Python function was whitelisted: `datetime.datetime.fromisoformat()`
- Some polish to the commands page for the `groups` module. 
- Renamed `CreateScript` to `DeployAutonomousScript` to contrast it from `UpdateScript` a little better.  

ꙨꙪ Happy Coding Ꙭꙮ
