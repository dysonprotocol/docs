## How to Buy DYS: A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started with the Dyson Protocol

**Introduction**

Are you excited about diving into the world of Decentralized Web Apps (DWapps) using the Dyson Protocol? To get started, you'll need to acquire some DYS tokens. This step-by-step guide will show you how to buy DYS using Osmosis (ATOM) (or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)) on the Osmosis Frontier.

**Step 1: Prepare your Kepler Wallet**

Before you can buy DYS, you'll need to have either Osmosis (ATOM) or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in your Kepler Wallet. If you don't have a Kepler Wallet yet, visit https://www.keplr.app/ to create one.

**Step 2: Buy Osmosis (ATOM)**

If you don't already have Osmosis (ATOM) in your Kepler Wallet, you'll need to buy some first. You can do this on a cryptocurrency exchange that supports these tokens, such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. After purchasing the tokens, transfer them to your Kepler Wallet.

**Step 3: Access the Osmosis Frontier**

Navigate to the Osmosis Frontier by visiting the following URL: https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/905. This is where you can swap your Osmosis (ATOM) or for DYS tokens.

**Step 4: Trade your tokens for DYS**

Click on the "Trade Pair" button on the Osmosis Frontier page. This will open a new window where you can swap your Osmosis (ATOM) for DYS tokens.

**Step 5: Execute the swap**

Enter the amount of Osmosis (ATOM) you want to swap for DYS. Review the transaction details, including the exchange rate and any fees. Once you're satisfied, confirm the transaction to complete the swap. We suggest using the lowest fee.

**Step 6: Congratulations, you now own DYS tokens!**

You've successfully swapped your Osmosis (ATOM) for DYS tokens on the Osmosis Frontier. The DYS tokens will now be available to withdrawal to your Kepler Wallet.

**Step 7: Withdraw your DYS to your wallet (optional)**

For added security, it is recommended that you withdraw your DYS tokens from the Osmosis Frontier to your Kepler Wallet. To do this, follow the instructions provided by the Kepler Wallet interface.

**Conclusion**

With your newly-acquired DYS tokens, you're now ready to start exploring and building Decentralized Web Apps using the Dyson Protocol. Happy Coding!
