## Come and join our community and hunt down some bounties ##

Hey there, Dyson Protocol enthusiasts!

We know you love the fact that our project is 100% community-driven, and so do we! There are no external investors pulling the strings here, just our community of developers and users brainstorming, coding, and pushing the boundaries of the Dyson Blockchain.

Our bounties have always been a driving force, but we're not just about that - it's your ideas and apps that truly bring the Dyson Protocol to life! You guys never cease to amaze us with the innovative ways you find to improve the protocol and develop on-chain apps.

Now, let's talk about our latest bounty! We're currently on the lookout for an Weighted Ranked Voting script. If you've got the skills to create a script that implements this voting system, then we've got a reward of 5,000,000 DYS waiting for you!

So, what are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity, and let's make the Dyson Protocol even better together! Don't forget to have fun while you're at it, because that's what our community is all about. Join our Discord to find out all needed details or ask questions.

Happy Coding!
