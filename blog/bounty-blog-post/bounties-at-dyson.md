## Come and join our community and hunt down some bounties ##

Hey there, Dyson Protocol enthusiasts!

We know you love the fact that our project is 100% community-driven, and so do we! There are no external investors pulling the strings here, just our community of developers and users brainstorming, coding, and pushing the boundaries of the Dyson Blockchain.

Our bounties have always been a driving force, but we're not just about that - it's your ideas and apps that truly bring the Dyson Protocol to life! You guys never cease to amaze us with the innovative ways you find to improve the protocol and develop on-chain apps.

Now, let's talk about our latest bounty! We're currently on the lookout for an Weighted Ranked Voting script. If you've got the skills to create a script that implements this voting system, then we've got a reward of 5,000,000 DYS waiting for you!

Here are the requirements:

- Create a ballot of options, start and end dates.
- Allow the ballot admin to add or remove weighted members before the start.
- Enable users to vote on the options in a ranked format.
- Tally the results at the end.

No front-end UI is required for this project. If you're up for the challenge, please check out the links provided to learn more about ranked and weighted voting.
