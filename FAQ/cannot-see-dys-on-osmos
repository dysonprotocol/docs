###Why can I not see my Dyson mainnet balance on Osmosis?###

It's a common misunderstanding that having DYS coins in your Keplr Wallet will automatically make them visible on the Osmosis Frontier. In reality, you need to deposit your DYS coins from your Keplr Wallet to the Osmosis platform first, before you can use them for swapping or other activities on the Osmosis Frontier.

#Here's a step-by-step guide to help you deposit your DYS coins to Osmosis#

1. Visit the Osmosis website and go to https://frontier.osmosis.zone/
2. Connect your Keplr Wallet by clicking on the "Connect Wallet" button on the top right corner.
3. Once your wallet is connected, click on the "Assets" tab on the top navigation bar.
4. Find the DYS coin in the list of assets. 
5. Click on the "Deposit" button next to the DYS logo.
6. Enter the amount of DYS you want to deposit from your Keplr Wallet to the Osmosis platform.
7. Review the transaction details, including any associated fees, and confirm the transaction. We recommend using the lowest fees.

Once the transaction is successful, your DYS coins will be visible and available for use on the Osmosis Frontier. Please note that depositing your DYS coins to Osmosis might involve network fees, so make sure to check the transaction details before confirming the deposit.
